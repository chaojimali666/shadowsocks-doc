description: 'ShadowSocks is a secure socks5 proxy, designed to protect your Internet traffic. It encrypts the traffic between you and the servers, so nobody can spy on you. The main difference compare to VPN is that Shadowsocks is not global, which means not all your traffic will go through the servers.'
