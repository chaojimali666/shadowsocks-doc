description: 'ShadowSocks is a cross platform and fast tunnel proxy that helps you bypass firewalls available for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iPhone. Its a secure socks5 proxy, designed to protect your Internet traffic. It encrypts the traffic between you and the servers, so the Internet Service Providers can not spy on you, once the ISP do not know what you are looking for, they will not stop the traffic, so you can bypass the restrictions by the ISP and can easily penetrate corporate firewalls and access censored sites. Letâ€™s say if you find yourself in a situation where OpenVPN traffic is blocked or throttled, ShadowSocks is a good alternative to a VPN that can be installed in OpenWRT routers to tunnel the entire network traffic. That software tunnels encrypts your Internet browsing. If you want to use an Instant Messenger or a uTorrent, you will have to configure those programs settings to use the applicable Socks 5 proxy and port. The main difference compare to VPN is Shadowsocks is not global, which means not all your traffic will go through the servers. VPN is global, once you connect to VPN servers, all your traffic will go through the servers and the main benefits of Shadowsocks is you can choose which traffic will go through the server and which will not.
