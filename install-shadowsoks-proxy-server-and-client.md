[ShadowSocks](https://shadowsocks.org/) is a secure socks5 proxy, designed to protect your Internet traffic. It encrypts the traffic between you and the servers, so nobody can spy on you. The main difference compare to VPN is that Shadowsocks is not global, which means not all your traffic will go through the server. If you want to use an Instant Messenger or a uTorrent, you will have to configure those programs settings to use the applicable Socks 5 proxy and port.

![Install ShadowSocks on Ubuntu 16.04](https://github.com/nastavnjc/shadowsocks-doc/blob/master/install-shadowsocks-on-ubuntu-16-04.png "Install ShadowSocks on Ubuntu 16.04")

Letâ€™s say if you find yourself in a situation where OpenVPN traffic is blocked or throttled, ShadowSocks is a good alternative to tunnel the entire network traffic.

## Before You Begin

1.  Complete the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide.

2.  Follow the [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server/) guide to create a standard user account, harden SSH access and remove unnecessary network services; this guide will use `sudo` wherever possible. Do **not** follow the *Configuring a Firewall* section--this guide has instructions specifically for an Odoo production server.

3.  Log in to your Linode via SSH and check for updates using `apt-get` package manager.

        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

## Open Corresponding Firewall Ports

In this case we're using ShadowSocks's default port 8000, but this could be any port you specify later in the configuration file.

    sudo ufw allow ssh
    sudo ufw allow 8000/tcp
    sudo ufw enable
