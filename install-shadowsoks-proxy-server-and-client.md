[ShadowSocks](https://shadowsocks.org/) is a secure socks5 proxy, designed to protect your Internet traffic. It encrypts the traffic between you and the servers, so nobody can spy on you. The main difference compare to VPN is that Shadowsocks is not global, which means not all your traffic will go through the servers. If you want to use an Instant Messenger or a uTorrent, you will have to configure those programs settings to use the applicable Socks 5 proxy and port.

Letâ€™s say if you find yourself in a situation where OpenVPN traffic is blocked or throttled, ShadowSocks is a good alternative to a VPN that can be installed in OpenWRT routers to tunnel the entire network traffic. That software tunnels encrypts your Internet browsing.
